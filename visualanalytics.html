    <h> Chapter 2: Visual Analytics </h>
    <p> Visual analytics is a combination of automated analysis and
        interactive visualisations. The goal of visual analytics are <span style="background-color: aquamarine;">  </span> Visual analytics is essential in the application of physics
        and astronomy where large information spaces have to be processed and analysed. It can help determine the on-going progress of an emergency and identify the next countermeasures.</p>
    <p>The visual analytics process combines automatic and visual analysis methods automated and visual analysis through interaction with a tight coupling through human interaction in order to gain knowledge
        from data.In order to discover knowledge, the visual analytics process combines the interaction between data, visualization, models about the data, and the users. Data should be presented on screen
    by analysing first, the show the important, zoom/filter, analyse further, details on demand.</p>
    <p>Visualization is classified into two categories: <span style="background-color: aquamarine;">scientific visualization and information visualization.</span> Scientific visualization
        is a 3-D phenomena whereas information visualization is for abstract data with many dimensions.</p>
    <p>Data Management: data of various types and qualities should be managed very efficiently in visual analytics. Data management techniques increasingly make use of intelligent data
        analysis techniques and also on visualisation to optimise processes and inform the user.</p>
    <p>Data Mining: An automatic extraction of valuable information from raw data using automatic analysis algorithms is referred as Data Mining. Those algorithms can be supervised or unsupervised
    learning algorithm.</p>

    <h> Chapter 3: Data Management </h>
    <p>  This chapter reviews the field of data management with respect to visual analytics and reviews current database technology. It then summarises the problems that can arise when dealing with
        large, complex and heterogeneous dataset or data streams. A scenario is given, which illustrates tight integration of data management and visual analytics. </p>
    <p>The state of the art section also considers techniques for the integration of data and issues relating to data reduction, including visual data reduction techniques and the related topic of visual
    quality metrics. </p>
    <p>The challenges section identifies important issues, such as dealing with uncertainties in the data and the integrity of the results, the management of semantics the emerging area of data streaming, interactive visualisation of large databases and database issues concerning distributed and
        collaborative visual analytics.</p>
